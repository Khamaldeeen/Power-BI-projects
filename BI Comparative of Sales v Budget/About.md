# Power-BI-projects
My projects containing dashboard developments using Power BI

<p>Hi, welcome to my dashboard design of current sales versus budgeted sales. </p>

<p>This project is an open source and data used was sourced publicly hence, no PII included in the list of the datasets. </p>

<p>With this dashboard, companies are able to compare their YOY%, Budget variance and over all sales performance for each year. </p>

<p>Also, a chart that allows forecasting of sales is included. This is a responsive dashboard and more datas related can be added to the excel file and with a refresh, it is updated. </p>
